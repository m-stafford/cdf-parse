# CDF Parser for THEMIS
## Overview
This mess of Python and C is what I used during my research to pull and parse THEMIS data into something I could easily analyze. The gist of it is that the Python script is used to pull files from the remote server and the C program is used to extract the time-series magnenometer data for analysis of dipolarization events.

This was written in a fever dream and has very much not been touched since I pulled the data for my research. Leaving it up incase another student in the future wants to play with THEMIS data and because I'm kind of curious about the data still.
