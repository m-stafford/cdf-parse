# CDF Parser for THEMIS
## Overview
This mess of Python and C is what I used during my research to pull and parse THEMIS data into something I could easily analyze. The gist of it is that the Python script is used to pull files from the remote server and the C program is used to extract the time-series magnenometer data for analysis of dipolarization events.
